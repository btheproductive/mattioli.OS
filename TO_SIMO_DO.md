# Manual Actions Required

## Post-Implementation Steps

### 1. Deploy to GitHub Pages
After the automatic build process completes, you need to deploy the updated version to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### 2. PWA Update (Critical Step)
**IMPORTANT for iOS Users**:
We have updated the icon to v2 (`pwa-icon-v2.png`) to fix caching issues.

1.  **Delete** the existing "Mattioli.OS" app from your Home Screen.
2.  Open Safari and visit `https://simo-hue.github.io/mattioli.OS/`.
3.  Tap "Share" -> "Add to Home Screen".
4.  **Verify**: You should now see the NEW **Target/Growth** icon (Neon Purple/Teal on Black).
5.  Launch the app.

### 3. Verify in Google Search Console
Test the URL: `https://simo-hue.github.io/mattioli.OS/features`

### 4. Test All Routes
Verify that all public and app routes are working correctly.

Verify App Routes (Authentication Required):
- https://simo-hue.github.io/mattioli.OS/sw/dashboard
- https://simo-hue.github.io/mattioli.OS/sw/stats
- https://simo-hue.github.io/mattioli.OS/sw/macro-goals
- https://simo-hue.github.io/mattioli.OS/sw/ai-coach

## Notes
- The build script now automatically generates static HTML files for all public routes
- No additional manual steps are needed during the build process
